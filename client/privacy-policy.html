            This Privacy Policy explains how Platieu (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you
            visit our website or place an order/reservation through our forms. By using this site, you agree to the
            practices described below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information you provide to us may include details like your name, email address, phone number, and (for
            delivery) your address. If you leave notes with an order or reservation (for example, allergies or special
            requests), we store that text so our team can prepare your meal and support your visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also collect limited information automatically when you use the site, such as basic log data (for
            example, IP address, device/browser type, and approximate time of access) and technical data needed for the
            site to function. Our pages may load resources from third parties (for example, fonts from Google Fonts),
            which can result in those providers receiving standard connection data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use your information to operate the site, process and confirm orders/reservations, communicate with you,
            improve our menus and services, and help prevent fraud or abuse. We do not use sensitive personal
            information for targeted advertising, and we do not send marketing emails unless you explicitly ask for
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may share information with service providers that help us run our website and fulfill requests (for
            example, hosting, email delivery, and operational tools). These providers are permitted to use information
            only to perform services for us. We do not sell your personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by contacting us. Please
            note we may retain certain records when required for legitimate business purposes (such as resolving
            disputes, complying with legal obligations, and maintaining basic security logs). Our site is intended for a
            general audience and is not designed to knowingly collect information from children.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for legal, operational,
            or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date on this page.
